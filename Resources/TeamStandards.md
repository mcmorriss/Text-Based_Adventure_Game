Code Repo:  Git Flow or Trunk-Based Development? Or some variant of each? 

Frequent Commits / Frequent Builds:  Your Progress Report assignments encourage this!

Message boards (Slack, Discord) are a must! 

Meetings:  Use a low-overhead polling system, like when2meet.com to schedule.

Task Board:  Something like Trello is great, but only if it is used. 

Good Communication:  Does Everyone Understand What was Decided? What to Do?

Respectful Communication: 

Reach out for help early and often!

Don't over-engineer anything, and beware of feature-creep. Don't let "Perfect" Be the Enemy of "Good".
